# 🌦️ Australia Rainfall Prediction

## 🔍 Project Overview
Australia's highly variable climate makes rainfall prediction crucial for agriculture, water management, and disaster preparedness. This project leverages historical weather data and machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model for rainfall, helping stakeholders make informed decisions. By analyzing meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure, the model aims to generate accurate rainfall forecasts.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Programming**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Machine Learning**: Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Gradient Boosting
- **Data Processing**: Feature engineering, data cleaning, normalization
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib & Seaborn for exploratory analysis
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive data exploration & model development

## 📂 Folder Structure
